Latest addition to the “Configuration Management”, Ansible outperformed its elders (Chef, Puppet…) by offering an alternative solution. Ansible is a simple and efficient solution to automate complex infrastructure and applications deployment.
You’ll learn how to handle this tool, how to manage its playbooks, its roles, the modules and how to implement it in your own infrastructure.
